For assignments, I plan to use the VSCode application to put my completed assignments on Github. Although I am not opposed to the other methods and could navigate them, I found using the VSCode method the easiest to understand. I also think it will be the easiest method for keeping track of assignments on my desktop. Finally, I found it easy to do the “Push and Sync.” Over the semester, I may try alternative methods for loading completed assignments to Github, but I plan to start with VSCode.
